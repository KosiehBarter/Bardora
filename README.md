# Bardora / Barterdora / Bartera
A (maybe too much) lightweight unofficial Fedora spin.

## What it is?

Bardora / Bartera is a unofficial spin based on Fedora. Because Fedora is more often updated and there are more releases than other distros, a Kickstart file is used for simplified installation. Bardora is built upon very lightweight Window Manager, Openbox with just commandline tools as well as some X programs, like Firefox, Hexchat and such.

The X is here for programs that don't exist in CLI version (for example games, graphical browsers...). Also, X is here to cover more advanced tasks like creating / editing certain things, that are easier to accomplish in GUI mode.

For imagination, classic spins like LXDE / MATE (and so on) take some time to be developed / assembled, Bardora is based on netinstall images and therefore is mostly (if not allways) updated and also, there is no requirement for additional time needed for assembly. The "assembly" is completed right on destination machine (like Gentoo, but not compiled from scratch).

## How to use it?

From the beginning, you can use Openbox's menu. With additional customization (Work in progress - planned function) a "Run" dialog can be used. There is no "advanced" task switcher, just basic one, also, to save CPU resources for more demanding tasks.

TO cover specific tasks like connection to internet, CLI tools are used. For example, nmtui (Text UI for Network Manager) is used.

## Warning

This spin is NOT designed for starters. If you are new to Fedora, do not use this spin. Use MATE / LXDE / LXQT or any other beginner-friendly spin of Fedora. This spin is designed for advanced users, who know what commands to use.

Also, in this stage, Bardora is in Alpha-stage. Not because of quality of programs installed, but because of settings of the operating system. Still, "Work In Progress".

## "Licence"

Licence is based on original Fedora distribution. You can copy / edit / enhance whatever you like. Personally (speaking as author), I would like to ask for feedback, enhancements.

The only requirement that I require is to keep Bardora as much lightweight as it can be, without any bloatware that is contained in traditional Desktop Environments.

Also, if you would like to contribute, create a new branch, instead of cloning new repo. I don't say that you can't clone it (clone it if you really like to), but I would like to see other's people creations and maybe base work on better results with proper credit.

In other words, play with it as you like. And also, no copyright violations intented.

## Little about me

I am amateur in this development. I've decided to create a very lightweight spin, that will meet my needs. This is not a professional product.
